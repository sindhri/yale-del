				The summer internship for undergraduates is designed for college 
		students who are either currently studying or are interested in 
		psychology/psychiatry or child-related medicine.<br>
		<br>
		NATURE OF INTERNSHIP: Interns will join a clinical/investigative group 
		working primarily with a high-risk population of children ranging in age 
		from three months to fourteen years. Interns will have the opportunity 
		to interact with leading child psychiatrists and neuroscientists who are 
		studying early brain development, working with children with pervasive 
		developmental/psychiatric disorders. This experience is structured to 
		provide a view of both medical research and clinical medical care as 
		practiced in an academic department of a medical school.<br>
		<br>
		SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE INTERNS WILL GAIN: Interns will gain a basic 
		introduction to developmental pediatrics and child development. The 
		internship will help develop skills in administering developmental 
		computer tasks to children and in reviewing medical records. Interns 
		will also gain an introduction to semi-structured and open-ended 
		interviewing techniques for adults and children.<br>
		<br>
		INTERN'S DUTIES: Interns will assist in the developmental and 
		psychological evaluations of<br>
		children; complete behavioral scoring protocols from videotaped records 
		of assessments; and review, under supervision, medical records of 
		participating children. Opportunities to participate in other lab 
		projects will also arise.<br>
		<br>
		COMPENSATION: Interns will be compensated for their time and work with 
		$2,500.00 for the ten week duration of the internship.<br>
		<br>
		If you wish to be considered for participation in the internship, please 
		send your résumé, a cover letter, two letters of recommendation, a 
		writing sample, and your academic transcript to Dr. Linda Mayes at the 
		following address:<br>
